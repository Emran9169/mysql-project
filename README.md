# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The main objective of this project is to achieve a clean and well-organized dataset with reliable data integrity. my main goals of this project are as follows:
1. Get a simplified and understandable data after going through a serious of a cleaning step inorder to eliminate unnecessary, bulky , missing values, and inconsistencies. so that anyone looking at the data will get agreat insight and can retrieve any information that he wants to get.
2. Develop and execute a thorough Quality Assurance (QA) process to validate the cleaned data against the original dataset. so I wanted to make sure the cleaned data adheres to predefined standards and requirements.

## Process
step 1. Data Exploration which means I conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset to gain a deep understanding of its structure and content.
step 2. Data Assesment which is identifying any missing or unnecessary data to guarantee the dataset's quality so, I examined the large amount of data to simplify
it for easier understanding.
step 3. Before I started cleaning the data i tried to answer the questions that are in the project so that I can gain a good insight of the data. This step helped
establish a solid understanding of the data's intricacies.
step 4. I formulated additional questions based on newfound insights from the initial analysis. once I am done with the questions i A nswered these self-generated
questions to extract further meaningful information
step 5. after I finished the above stpes I started the data cleaning process. first, I tried to note elements that needed removal, including redundant information
and duplicates within and across tables.
After that I prepared a plan for the data cleaning process and executed this long process of data cleaning especially on all_sesions and analytics table. As these
tables are very bulky and needs a thorough cleaning and then i was able to effectively create a refined version of the database.
step 5. Initiated a QA process to validate the cleaned data against the original dataset. i wanted to make sure in general as the data is free from missing values 
and duplicates. In general I ensured that the refined data met predefined standards and maintained its integrity

## Results
The comprehensive approach to data exploration, assessment, and cleaning produced in a modified dataset that is now more efficient, relevant, and conducive to
meaningful analysis. e initial and self-generated questions provided valuable insights, guiding the cleaning process and contributing to a more insightful final
dataset.
## Challenges 
Given the bulkiness of the dataset, there were various difficulties encountered during the data cleaning procedure.
Addressing duplicates and ensuring the removal of irrelevant information required careful consideration. Especially, as there is no anything that explains about 
the relation of the columns both in tables as well as across table, it was challenging what each column means.
Despite these challenges, I tried my best so that the result or the dataset i created aligns with the project goals.


## Future Goals
Given more time, I would explore additional methods for analysis and potentially implement furthersteps to the cleaning process. Additionally, I would try to add more columns to provide more detailed insights into the dataset.
